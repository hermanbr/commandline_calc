# commandline_calc
Calculator that works in terminal. Idea is to have a "bash" type calculator, where user can type "calc <expr>" in terminal, and get the sum.

Uses the Shunting Yard Algorithm to change expression from prefix to Reversen Polish Notation, which makes it easier to use the correct priority of the operations.
